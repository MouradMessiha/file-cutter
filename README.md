# file cutter
This C# program cuts a slice of a file to create a new file.  
Compile and run the program. Select a file using the open file dialog, enter the starting position of the slice (zero based), then enter the end position of the slice.  
The sliced file will be created in the same folder as the source file, and will be called filepart.txt.
